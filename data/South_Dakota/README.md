### Source

State-wide polling place data for 2012-2018 general elections was obtained from the Secretary of State through a public records request.

### Notes

Where possible, we flagged `vote centers` in the `polling_place_type` field. For some years, the vote-centers weren't explicitly added but were just all assigned to every single precinct in the county. In these cases, we only reatined the first record of the vote center.

The 2014 data does have the address column, but the data provided by the Secretary of State only contained the last line information (City, State, Zip)

We were unable to identify any vote centers in the 2012 data. Additionally, the 2012 file provided by the secretary of state did not contain any address information (only building names).
