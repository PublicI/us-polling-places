  Where possible, we flagged vote centers in the polling_place_type field. For some years, the vote-centers weren't explicitly added but were just all assigned to every single precinct in the county. In these cases, we only reatined the first record of the vote center.
  The 2014 data does have the address column, but the data provided by the Secretary of State only contained the last line information (City, State, Zip)
  We were unable to identify any vote centers in the 2012 data. Additionally, the 2012 file provided by the secretary of state did not contain any address information (only building names).
