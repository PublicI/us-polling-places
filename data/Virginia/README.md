### Source

State-wide polling place data for 2012-2014 general elections was provided by the Voting Information Project with permission from the Secretary of State. The data for 2016 and 2018 was obtained from the Secretary of State through a public records request.

### Notes

The system used by the Virgnia board of elections does not reliably track historical precinct names. Depending on how the county clerks recorded precinct changes ("editing" vs "deleting") - the precinct name column for 2016 might reflect the precinct as it was named in 2018. This only affects a small percent of precincts which say a change in their boundary or name during the study period. We are working on updating this dataset with the correct precincts substituted for the historical data.
