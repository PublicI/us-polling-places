  The data for 2012, 2014 is missing the county_name column because the underlying data from the Voting Information Project did not contain this information.
  The system used by the Virgnia board of elections does not reliably track historical precinct names. Depending on how the county clerks recorded precinct changes ("editing" vs "deleting") - the precinct name column for 2016 might reflect the precinct as it was named in 2018. This only affects a small percent of precincts which say a change in their boundary or name during the study period. We are working on updating this dataset with the correct precincts substituted for the historical data.
  This issue ONLY affects precinct names. The polling locations themselves seem to be accurately reflected.
