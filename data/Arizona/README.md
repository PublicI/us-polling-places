### Source

State-wide polling place data for 2012-2018 general elections was obtained from the Secretary of State through a public records request.

Maricopa county polling locations were obtained from the Maricopa County Elections website.

### Notes

The following counties use either partial or full vote centers: Cochise, Coconino, Gila, Graham, Greenlee, La Paz, Maricopa, Mohave, Navajo, Santa Cruz, Yavapai, Yuma.

We have tried to accurately flag "vote-centers" in Arizona. (Usually based on name or precinct name). However, this method isn't perfect and it is possible that we might have missed some. If you find any vote-centers that are not identified or incorrectly identified, please reach out to Pratheek Rebala <prebala@publicintegrity.org>

In Maricopa county, we couldn't readily identify vote centers in the list provided on the county clerk's website. Thus, all the polling places have been flagged as "unknown".
