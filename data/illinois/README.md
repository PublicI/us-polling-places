### Source

State-wide polling place data for 2012-2018 general elections was obtained from the Illinois Secretary of State through a public records request.

### Notes

N.B: The elections seem to be held at the city/county level. We've imputed county_name from the jurisdiction where possible.

Aurora, IL is part of more than one county ( DuPage, Kane, Kendall, Will) hence the county_name column is null.
