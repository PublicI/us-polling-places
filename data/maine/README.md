### Source

State-wide polling place data for the 2012-2018 general elections were acquired from the Maine Secretary of State's through a public records request.

### Notes

The SoS provided this data but is unable to confirm that these were the finalized polling places that were used in this election. Several municipalties were consolidated after the 2012 election which means there would be some municipalities that are present in the 2012 file but not in the 2014-2018 data.
