### Source

State-wide polling place data for the 2016 and 2018 general elections were acquired from the Minnesota Secretary of State through a public records request. The data for the 2014 election was provided by the Voting Information Project with permission from the MN SoS.

The data for the 2012 general election was collected through individual public records requests to each of the 87 counties in Minnesota.

### Notes

The 2014 data from VIP seems to contain duplicate "precinct names". This is happening because of additional district information that's getting appended to the `precinct_name` column. E.g. `SEVERANCE TWP._ISD_2365`, `SEVERANCE TWP`. However, addresses are identical for all these rows. The duplicate rows are included here as a reference.
