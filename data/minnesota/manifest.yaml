  The 2014 data from VIP seems to contain duplicate "precinct names". This is happening because of additional district information that's getting appended to the precinct_name column. E.g. SEVERANCE TWP._ISD_2365, SEVERANCE TWP.
  However, addresses are identical for all these rows. The duplicate rows are included here as a reference.
