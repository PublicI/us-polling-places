Learn more about this data here: [National data release sheds light on past polling place changes.](https://publicintegrity.org/politics/elections/ballotboxbarriers/data-release-sheds-light-on-past-polling-place-changes)

This data release contains standardized data on polling locations that were used in each election cycle since 2012 for all the states covered by the dataset. The initial release contains 30 states, with more to be added in the coming weeks.

### Status

The initial release (2020-09-29) of this data contains data for the following states:

*Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin.*

### Geocodes

Wherever possible, we have also included a geocode for each polling location. This geocode represents a “best guess” based on cross referencing responses from 3 different services. While we have made every effort to ensure the accuracy of the location information, geocoding is an imperfect science and we recommend that users perform manual validation when drawing conclusions from this data.

### Provenance

This data was primarily acquired through public records requests to state or county election officials. In some cases, when state election officials no longer had the data, they authorized the Voting Information Project to release any data that was available in their archives. The source of each election year’s data is mentioned in the state’s README file. Additionally, the state README file contains any additional caveats about the data that you need to be aware of.

### Acknowledgements
