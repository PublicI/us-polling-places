### Provenance

This data was primarily acquired through public records requests to state or county election officials. In some cases, when state election officials no longer had the data, they authorized the Voting Information Project to release any data that was available in their archives. The source of each election year’s data is mentioned in the state’s README file. Additionally, the state README file contains any additional caveats about the data that you need to be aware of.

This data set is only as good as the information that is provided by state and local officials. Often times polling places can be moved under "emergency changes" which might not be reflected in this dataset.

We have made our best effort to ensure that the standardized data reflects the source documents as closely as possible. However, if you find any errors or any missing data, please open an Issue or reach out to Pratheek Rebala at <prebala@publicintegrity.org>.
